                <p class="about_p">I have been married to my wife for over 14 years now and we have four wonderful children, three girls and one boy.  I have a lot of hobbies that I enjoy, but the one I like the most is coaching archery.  I currently coach my children's competition archery team and am a certified National Archery in the Schools Program (NASP) Basic Archery Instructor and Trainer (BAI and BAIT) as well as a certified USA Archery Level 3 Coach.  I also enjoy playing hockey, board games, 3D printing, and anything that gets me out on the water, like kayaking and sailing.</p>

                <h3 class="about_p">Professional</h3>
                <p class="about_p">I served in the US Navy from 2001 until 2005 as an Intelligence Specialist.  After that I worked with various agencies conducting Intelligence Analysis until about 2013.  I have always enjoyed technology, including programming, so I decided to go back to college and earned my Bachelor's Degree in Information Tehcnology (Enterprise Developement using .NET) from American Military University.  I have been working in the IT field ever since in a multitude of roles including; Developer, System Admin, Project Lead, Product Owner and Scrum Master.</p>
